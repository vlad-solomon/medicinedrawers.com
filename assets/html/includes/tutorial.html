  <p>It looks like this is the first time you visit the site so allow me to explain a few things before you get on with the learning.</p>
  <p>We have your side when it comes to archiving and displaying your progress through the subjects, so don’t worry about losing time searching for where you last left off.</p>
  <p>When you finish a subject simply mark it as read and Medicine Drawers will help you remember what you have studied. Also, when you start reading a subject, it will automatically be marked as in progress, that way you’ll now what you have to finish learning. </p>
